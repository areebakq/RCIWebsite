		<h1>The Refugee Care Initative</h1>

		<h2>WHO ARE WE?</h2>

		<p>The Refugee Care Initiative is a nonprofit established in order to provide a rather unheard voice for refugees, help them assimilate in portions of the United States, and provide educational and career-based help.</p>

		<h2>WHAT DO WE DO?</h2>

		<p>Our services include:</p>

		<ul class="p">
			<li>Sponsor families when they have used up/lost food stamps, need educational supplies, require housing furniture, and other basic needs</li>
			<li>Empower refugees through a blogging platform that can enable them to share their stories as well as publish a book</li>
			<li>Provide technology applications (ex: apps) that can enable better communication between the nonprofit and the clients, track supply (food, bedding, supplies) count, and aid refugees therapeutically</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>WHY IS THIS IMPORTANT?</h2>

		<p>Refugees are people who have left their country forcibly due to unfavorable conditions. According to the UN Refugee Agency there are currently 65.6 million people in the world that are forcibly displaced worldwide. Out of that selected demographic, 10 million people are declared “stateless”. To clearly understand the problem at hand, it is crucial for the public to understand what a refugee is. Due to the recent unfavorable political events, there has been an association present with refugees and those who harm the country. For this particular reason, many refugees not only struggle with cultural and health issues but also social problems because of the societal rejection they face constantly. These problems include and are not limited to: difficulty speaking and learning English, raising children and helping them succeed in school, securing work, securing housing, accessing services, and transportation.</p>
